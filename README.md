# Ratatouille Recipe App - Exam Project

Welcome to the Ratatouille Recipe App! This project is designed for an iOS development exam. The goal is to create an application that integrates with an external API to download and save recipe information, using Core Data for saving. The app allows users to search for recipes, save favorites, and explore a variety of culinary delights.

# Exam Conditions
- **Compatibility**: The app must work with iPhone XR and newer models. You can use the latest Xcode 15 and compile for iOS 17.
- **Individual Project**: This is a written, individual, take-home exam.
- **Code Structure**: The code should be well-structured, efficient, and easy to read. It should meet all functional requirements.
- **Visual Design**: The visual design should follow established design guidelines. Use Assets in Xcode to organize and optimize graphical resources like colors, icons, and images.
- **User Interface**: The user interface must be in Norwegian, while the Swift code should be exclusively in English.
- **Compilation**: The code must compile and run directly in the iPhone simulator.
- **Empty Database**: The application must be delivered with an empty database. Users should be guided during the initial startup.

# Application Features
- **API Integration**: The app integrates with TheMealDB.COM, an open and free database with 302 recipes, 575 ingredients, and 302 images.
- **Recipe Search**: Users can search for recipes based on country, category, ingredients, and text search.
